 - Dictionaries
 - Classes and Objects

Explanation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Lists and Slicing
   - A List is a collection of elements that are mutable while tuples are immutable.
   - Individual elements of a list can be accessed by passing the respective index in [ ].
   - ' : ' is called the colon operator and is used to slice a list or string.
   - The number before the colon operator shows the start index and the number after the colon operator shows the end index - 1 till which to iterate.
   - A negative number can be used to iterate in reverse.
     
2. Functions
   - Functions are used to reuse blocks of code and are defined using the keyword 'def' and give back a value using the keyword 'return'.
   - A Function can be called by using the function name along with the required arguments.
     
3. Control Statements
   - if-else ladders use the keywords if, elif, and else and check whether one of the given conditions is true.
   - for i in List can be used to perform tasks on each element in the list for i in range(0, n) can be used to iterate from 0 to n-1.
   - The keyword type(i) can be used to return the data type of the element i.
     
4. File Handling
   - The open() function is used to open a file which takes the path of the file and the access mode in which to open it.
   - The title() function is used to capitalize the first letter of each word in a String.
   - The close() function is used to close the previously opened files.
     
5. Dictionaries
   - A Dictionary is a collection of elements consisting of pairs of elements i.e. keys and values where keys cannot be repeated and values can be repeated.
   - Values of a Dictionary can be accessed by passing the respective key in [ ].
     
6. Classes and Objects
   - Classes are a collection of data members and member functions and can be defined using the data type class.
   - Objects can be created using the Class name.
   - Individual elements of the object can be changed using the dot ' . ' operator which is used by writing the object along with . and the data member.
